        <h2>2. GRANT OF RIGHTS</h2>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
            grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
            license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display,
            publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
            Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and
            object code form.
          </p>
          <p>
            b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
            grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license
            under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and
            otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in
            source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the
            combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the
            Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the
            Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed
            Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations
            which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed
            hereunder.
          </p>
          <p>
            c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
            licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
            provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
            patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each
            Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by
            any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights
            or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses
            granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to
            secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For
            example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient
            to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire
            that license before distributing the Program.
          </p>
          <p>
            d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient
            copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright
            license set forth in this Agreement.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <h2>3. REQUIREMENTS</h2>
        <p>
          A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form
          under its own license agreement, provided that:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and
          </p>
          <p>
            b) its license agreement:
          </p>
          <p>
            i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties
            and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions
            of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of
            merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;
          </p>
          <p>
            ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for
            damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and
            consequential damages, such as lost profits;
          </p>
          <p>
            iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are
            offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and
          </p>
          <p>
            iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such
            Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable
            manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          When the Program is made available in source code form:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and
          </p>
          <p>
            b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the
            Program.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained
          within the Program.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its
          Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent
          Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.
        </p>
        <h2>4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION</h2>
        <p>
          Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities
          with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this
          license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the
          Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering
          should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for
          other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a
          commercial product offering, such Contributor (&quot;Commercial
          Contributor&quot;) hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other
          Contributor (&quot;Indemnified Contributor&quot;) against any losses,
          damages and costs (collectively &quot;Losses&quot;) arising from claims,
          lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the
          Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of
          such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the
          Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section
          do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged
          intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified
          Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing
          of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and
          cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related
          settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in
          any such claim at its own expense.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
          product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
          Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims,
          or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and
          warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under
          this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims
          against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and
          warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any
          damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those
          damages.
        </p>
        <h2>5. NO WARRANTY</h2>
        <p>
          EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED
          ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY
          KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY
          WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR
          FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for
          determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and
          assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this
          Agreement , including but not limited to the risks and costs of program
          errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data,
          programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of
          operations.
        </p>
        <h2>6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY</h2>
        <p>
          EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY
          CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,
          INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING
          WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF
          LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING
          NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION
          OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF
          ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
        </p>
        <h2>7. GENERAL</h2>
        <p>
          If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
          applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the
          remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by
          the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent
          necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
        </p>
        <p>
          If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a
          cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself
          (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)
          infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted
          under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is
          filed.
        </p>
        <p>
          All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to
          comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and
          does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming
          aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this
          Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the
          Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's
          obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient
          relating to the Program shall continue and survive.
        </p>
        <p>
          Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but
          in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only
          be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the
          right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from
          time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to
          modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement
          Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as
          the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of
          the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program
          (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version
          of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new
          version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute
          the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as
          expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no
          rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under
          this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise.
          All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are
          reserved.
        </p>
        <p>
          This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the
          intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to
          this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than
          one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to
          a jury trial in any resulting litigation.

        <h3>2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope</h3>
        <p>
          The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
          this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
          distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
          Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
          Contributor:

        <ol class="low-alpha">
          <li>
            <p>

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party’s

              Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
              Version); or

        </p>
        <h3>2.4. Subsequent Licenses</h3>
        <p>
          No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
          distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License
          (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted
          under the terms of Section 3.3).
        </p>
        <h3>2.5. Representation</h3>
        <p>
          Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
          Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to
          grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.
        </p>
        <h3>2.6. Fair Use</h3>
        <p>
          This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable
          copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.
        </p>
        <h3>2.7. Conditions</h3>
        <p>
          Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in
          Section 2.1.
        </p>
        <h2>3. Responsibilities</h2>
        <h2>3.1. Distribution of Source Form</h2>
        <p>
          All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
          Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
          the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code
          Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and
          how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter
          or restrict the recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form.
        </p>
        <h3>3.2. Distribution of Executable Form</h3>
        <p>If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:</p>
        <ol class="low-alpha">
          <li>
            <p>
              such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form,
              as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the
              Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by
              reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost
              of distribution to the recipient; and
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
              License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
              license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the
              recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form under this License.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work</h3>
        <p>
          You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
          provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
          the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
          Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
          Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License
          permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the
          terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger
          Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered Software under
          the terms of either this License or such Secondary License(s).
        </p>
        <h3>3.4. Notices</h3>
        <p>
          You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
          (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or
          limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the
          Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the
          extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.
        </p>
        <h3>3.5. Application of Additional Terms</h3>
        <p>
          You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
          indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
          Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
          behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such
          warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You
          alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
          liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
          indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
          disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
          jurisdiction.
        </p>
        <h2>4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation</h2>
        <p>
          If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
          License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
          statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the
          terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the
          limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a
          text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under
          this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation,
          such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary
          skill to be able to understand it.
        </p>
        <h2>5. Termination</h2>
        <p>
          5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if
          You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
          compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
          Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
          Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
          ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
          non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
          come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
          Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
          notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
          first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
          from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
          Your receipt of the notice.
        </p>
        <p>
          5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
          infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
          counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
          directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
          You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1
          of this License shall terminate.
        </p>
        <p>
          5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end
          user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have
          been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior
          to termination shall survive termination.
        </p>
        <h2>6. Disclaimer of Warranty</h2>
        <p>
          <em>
            Covered Software is provided under this License on an “as is” basis,
            without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory,
            including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is
            free of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or
            non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the
            Covered Software is with You. Should any Covered Software prove
            defective in any respect, You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of
            any necessary servicing, repair, or correction. This disclaimer of
            warranty constitutes an essential part of this License. No use of any
            Covered Software is authorized under this License except under this
            disclaimer.
          </em>
        </p>
        <h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>
          <em>
            Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort
            (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor,
            or anyone who distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable
            to You for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential
            damages of any character including, without limitation, damages for lost
            profits, loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or
            malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses, even if
            such party shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages.
            This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or
            personal injury resulting from such party’s negligence to the extent
            applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not
            allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential
            damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.
          </em>
        </p>
        <h2>8. Litigation</h2>
        <p>
          Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts
          of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of
          business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
          jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing
          in this Section shall prevent a party’s ability to bring cross-claims or
          counter-claims.
        </p>
        <h2>9. Miscellaneous</h2>
        <p>
          This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
          matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
          unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
          necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides
          that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter
          shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.
        </p>
        <h2>10. Versions of the License</h2>
        <h2>10.1. New Versions</h2>
        <p>
          Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
          10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or
          publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a
          distinguishing version number.
        </p>
        <h3>10.2. Effect of New Versions</h3>
        <p>
          You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of
          the License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or
          under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license
          steward.
        </p>
        <h3>10.3. Modified Versions</h3>
        <p>
          If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
          create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified
          version of this License if you rename the license and remove any
          references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such
          modified license differs from this License).
        </p>

        <p>GNU Lesser General Public License<br />
          Version 2.1, February 1999</p>
    
        <blockquote>
          <p>Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
            59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
            Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
            of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</p>
    
          <p>[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
            as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
            the version number 2.1.]</p></blockquote>
    
        <h3>Preamble</h3>
    
        <p> The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. </p>
    
        <p>This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.
        </p>
        <p> When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these things.</p>
    
        <p>To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
        </p>
        <p> For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights. </p>
    
        <p>We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library. </p>
    
        <p>To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the original version, so that the original author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by others. </p>
        <p>
          Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license. </p>
    
        <p>Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs. </p>
    
        <p>When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the library. </p>
    
        <p>We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain special circumstances. </p>
    
        <p>For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
        </p>
        <p>In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system. </p>
    
        <p> Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the Library.
        </p>
        <p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library". The former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order to run. </p>
    
        <h3>TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</h3>
    
        <p><strong>0.</strong> This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License"). Each licensee is addressed as "you".</p>
    
        <p> A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables. </p>
    
        <p> The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".) </p>
    
        <p> "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library.</p>
    
        <p>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does. </p>
    
        <p><strong>1.</strong> You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.
        </p>
        <p> You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. </p>
    
        <p><strong>2.</strong> You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
        </p>
    
        <blockquote>
          <p>a) The modified work must itself be a software library. </p>
          <p>b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.</p>
          <p>c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License. </p>
          <p>d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful. </p>
    
    
          <p> (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.)
          </p>
          <p> These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
          </p>
          <p>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library.
          </p>
          <p> In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.
          </p></blockquote>
        <p><strong>3.</strong> You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices. </p>
    
        <p>Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
        </p>
        <p> This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library.
        </p>
        <p><strong>4.</strong> You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.
        </p>
    
        <p>If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.</p>
    
        <p><strong>5.</strong> A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License. </p>
    
        <p> However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the library". The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables. </p>
    
        <p> When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law. </p>
    
        <p> If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.) </p>
    
        <p>Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself. </p>
    
        <p><strong>6.</strong> As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications. </p>
        <p>
          You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things: </p>
    
        <blockquote><p>a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.) </p>
    
          <p>b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the user's computer system, rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with. </p>
          <p>
            c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution. </p>
    
          <p>d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place. </p>
    
          <p>e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.</p>
        </blockquote>
    
        <p>For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable. </p>
    
        <p> It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute. </p>
    
        <p><strong>7.</strong> You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things: </p>
    
        <blockquote>
          <p>a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above. </p>
    
          <p>b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.</p></blockquote>
    
        <p><strong>8.</strong> You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. </p>
        <p>
          <strong>9.</strong> You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it. </p>
        <p>
          <strong>10.</strong> Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License. </p>
    
        <p><strong>11.</strong> If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library. </p>
        <p>
          If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances. </p>
    
        <p>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice. </p>
    
        <p>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License. </p>
        <p>
          <strong>12.</strong> If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License. </p>
        <p>
          <strong>13.</strong> The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.</p>
    
        <p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation. </p>
        <p>
          <strong>14.</strong> If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally. </p>
        <p>
          NO WARRANTY </p>
        <p>
          <strong>15. </strong>BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. </p>
        <p>
          <strong>16.</strong> IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. </p>
    
        <h3><strong>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</strong></h3>
    
        <h3>How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries</h3>
    
        If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public License).
        <p>
          To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
        </p>
    
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            &lt;one line to give the library's name and an idea of what it does.&gt;
            Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;
          </p>
    
    
          <p>This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
            modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
            License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
            version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.</p>
    
          <p>This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
            but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
            MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
            Lesser General Public License for more details.</p>
    
          <p>You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
            License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
            Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307 USA
          </p></blockquote>
    
        <p>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail. </p>
    
        <p>You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names: </p>
    
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in
            the library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written
            by James Random Hacker.</p>
    
          <p>signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1990<br />
            Ty Coon, President of Vice</p>
        </blockquote>
    
        That's all there is to it!
